# Fine-Tuning Whisper for Child Speech Recognition: An Evaluation of Adaptation and Augmentation Strategies

**Course:** Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) â€” 2024/2025

This repository contains code and experiments for evaluating Whisper's performance on child speech, specifically in Dutch. It is structured around two main research questions:

- **RQ1:** How well does Whisper pretrained on adult speech generalize to children's read speech? And to what extent does further fine-tuning on child-specific corpora enhance recognition accuracy?

- **RQ2:** Can speed perturbation and SpecAugment applied to adult speech during fine-tuning improve the performance of Whisper-small on Dutch child speech recognition?

Two corresponding folders are provided for each question's code and results.
